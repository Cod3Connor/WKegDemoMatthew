        <h2>How to Spot</h2>
        <p>Spotting human trafficking requires vigilance and awareness of certain red flags. Firstly, pay attention to signs of control and restriction, such as individuals who seem afraid, submissive, or unable to communicate freely. Sudden changes in appearance, behavior, or identification documents might also indicate trafficking. Keep an eye out for instances where someone else speaks for the person, especially when they seem unable to answer questions directly. Notice if the individual lacks personal belongings or appears disoriented in unfamiliar surroundings. Be cautious of situations where individuals are performing work excessively long hours for little or no pay, especially if their movements are heavily monitored. Trusting your instincts and contacting local law enforcement or a dedicated anti-trafficking hotline if you suspect something is amiss could potentially save someone from exploitation and abuse.</p>
